# A Case Study on Adverse Event Reporting in the Food and Cosmetics Industry :

## Background :
The CAERS database is a critical tool for the FDA, containing adverse event and product complaint reports related to foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. This dataset, covering the period from 2004 to the second quarter of 2017, includes detailed records of various products and associated adverse events. Each record is meticulously coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology, ensuring standardized reporting across different products. The data captures elements like report numbers, product roles, brand names, industry codes, patient demographics, adverse outcomes, and coded symptoms.

## Objective :
The primary objective of analyzing the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) dataset is to gain a comprehensive understanding of adverse events associated with foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics as reported to the FDA. This analysis aims to identify patterns and trends in these events, including the distribution across different product categories, the demographic characteristics of those affected, and the types and severities of reported symptoms and outcomes. By exploring these aspects, the analysis seeks to contribute valuable insights for enhancing product safety surveillance, informing regulatory policies, and ultimately improving public health outcomes by identifying potential risks and areas for intervention in the industries of food, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.
The dataset from the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) is a comprehensive collection of reports submitted to the FDA regarding adverse events and product complaints associated with foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. It spans from 2004 to the second quarter of 2017 and includes several key fields.

## Conclusion :
In this project, I utilized Tableau for data cleaning, modeling, and advanced analysis of adverse event data from the CAERS dataset. I began by importing and cleaning the data to address issues like missing values and standardize symptom names. Through various analyses, I explored the distribution of adverse events across product categories, assessed severity, examined demographic impacts, and identified temporal trends. I also delved into keyword analysis, product associations, and predictive modeling for event outcomes. Building an interactive dashboard in Tableau allowed me to visually showcase key insights such as event frequency, severity, and demographic distributions. Overall, this project enhanced my skills in data preparation, visualization, and advanced analytics, providing valuable insights into adverse event reporting and management.
